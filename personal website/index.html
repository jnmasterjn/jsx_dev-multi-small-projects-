        <h3 class="introduce-self">Hi Everyone, I'm XX from “place”. <br>
            I'm attending this school or class because it has always been something 
            I've been fascinated with or was looking forward to since childhood. 
            I love meeting new people and going on trips to art galleries 
            and I am more excited to learn more and gain more knowledge from this class. 
            Thank you.
        </h3>
